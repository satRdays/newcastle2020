description: "Scientific articles have been including more and more supplementary materials, which are ever more advanced. This has been facilitated by burgeoning technologies and available training. Another contributor was the replication crisis in psychology. As a result, nowadays, researchers customarily examine the data and code for studies, and the same may be done by members of the public, too. Standard materials such as data sets and code scripts could be referred to as Version 1.0. Excitingly, software developers and contributors have released Version 2.0 already! Let’s look at three interconnected applications. 1.  Binder environments —  Enable public access to your data and code in RStudio, directly on the Internet. We'll look at requirements and further possibilities, such as hosting Shiny apps. 2.  R Markdown documents —  Set your input and output in stone with R Markdown documents. They may be enriched with website features (CSS, 'pagedown'), and published as websites and PDF or Word documents. 3.  Online data dashboards —  A further step in open data is offered by online, interactive dashboards. These all-reproducible visualisations are published as websites, and therefore can include hyperlinks and downloadable files. Some of the R packages used are: knitr, reactable, ggplot, plotly, rmarkdown, flexdashboard, shiny. The aim is to look at different forms of dashboards (Flexdashboard, Shiny and Flexdashboard-Shiny), and the suitable platforms to host them online (personal websites, RPubs, Binder, Shinyapps and custom servers). A great thing is that dashboards may be made very simple, but they also offer the possibility of notable improvement. Real examples will be shown, common challenges flagged, and further resources provided. Background: https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/blob/master/README.md"
