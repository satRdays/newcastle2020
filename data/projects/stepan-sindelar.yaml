description: "FastR is a GraalVM-based implementation of the R language that provides significant improvements in the performance of R code; embedding of the R execution engine into Java applications; and the ability to interface with other GraalVM and JVM languages such as Python, Java, and Scala. FastR aims to be fully compatible with GNU-R: it can run unmodified popular complex CRAN packages such as ggplot2 or Shiny. The talk will look at how to get started with FastR and how well it works on real-world R code."
